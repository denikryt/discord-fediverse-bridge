# Known issues

- Verified: bridge-local bans do not remove existing remote subscriber rows and do not emit ActivityPub moderation activities.
- Verified: remote handle resolution remains string-only; WebFinger/actor fetch resolution is not implemented.
- Known operational behavior: a globally banned super-admin cannot unban themselves through Discord commands; recovery requires another non-banned super-admin or direct database intervention.

## Local-community relay outcome persistence is not atomic

Gateway outcomes are applied one row at a time through repository methods that open
separate sessions. If persistence fails after one outcome is committed, earlier
rows remain updated while later rows remain pending. Pending rows are retryable,
but the fanout call itself raises and does not return a complete summary.
